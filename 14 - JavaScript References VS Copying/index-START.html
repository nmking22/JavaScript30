  // and we want to make a copy of it.

  // You might think we can just do something like this:

  // however what happens when we update that array?

  // now here is the problem!

  // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

  // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

  // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

  // one way

  // or create a new array and concat the old one in

  // or use the new ES6 Spread

  // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

  // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

  // with Objects
  const person = {
    name: 'Wes Bos',
    age: 80
  };

const captain = person;
captain.number = 99;
console.log(person, captain)

const wes = {
name: 'Wes',
age: 100,
social: {
  twitter: '@wesbos',
  facebook: 'wesbos.developer'
}
}

console.log(wes)

const dev = Object.assign({}, wes);

dev.name = 'Wesley'

console.log(wes, dev)

const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));

console.log(dev2);
  // and think we make a copy:

  // how do we take a copy instead?

  // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

  // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.  </script>
